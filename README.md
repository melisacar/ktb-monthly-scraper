# KTB Monthly Scraper

## Error Handling

1. If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,

    - Use a Virtual Environment: Using a virtual environment allows you to manage your Python packages independently of the system-wide Python installation. Here’s how to create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3.13 -m venv venv 
# Here the path to venv is /Users/user_name/your_folder/ktb-monthly-scraper/venv
```
```bash
source /Users/user_name/your_folder/ktb-monthly-scraper/venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
python3 -m pip install xyz
```
